## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

This project taught me how to center a div in the middle of the webpage using the absolute property, as you can see below.

```css
.card-container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

This project made me realize I'm not very familiar with the 'position' property and its attributes and how useful it can be sometimes. I will look further into it to solidify my knowledge.
